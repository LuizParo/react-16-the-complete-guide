This repo contains all the projects, assignments and challenges made throughout this course. The main project is the <a href="https://github.com/LuizParo/react-16-the-complete-guide/tree/master/00-burger-builder">Burger Builder</a> (find the details below), where all the concepts learned in this course were applied. The other projects are more focused in specific concepts, such as routing, redux, etc., which makes them a great source when trying to deep diving into these.
